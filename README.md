# ExifReader

Inspired by an episode of [ATP](https://atp.fm) and by this [blog post](https://alexwlchan.net/2020/10/how-do-i-use-my-iphone-cameras/) by Alex Chan I decided to write a simple app to find out which lenses I use the most on my iPhone.


When you run the app it will ask to access the library and will scan for pictures, collect the EXIF data and at the end show you a table with the aggregated data of LensModel.
The slider on the top let you specify a limit, the pictures are in order of date so you get the most recent ones. 

If you have pictures on the cloud and optimise space on the iPhone, you need to toggle the network switch on. I suggest doing so in Wi-Fi as pictures will be downloaded from the network.
